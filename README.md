**YouTube Data Analysis Project**

This project involves the utilization of the YouTube Data API from Google Cloud Platform to gather and analyze data related to YouTube channels and their videos. The following tasks have been accomplished:

**1. API Key Creation**

An API key has been generated on the Google Cloud Platform to authenticate and authorize requests made to the YouTube Data API. This key is crucial for accessing YouTube data programmatically.

**2. List of Channel IDs**

A list of YouTube channel IDs has been curated. These IDs represent the unique identifiers for various YouTube channels that will be analyzed in this project.

**3. Channel Statistics Function**

A Python function has been defined to fetch channel statistics using the YouTube Data API. This function takes a channel ID as input and retrieves details such as subscribers, total number of videos, and views for the specified channel.

**4. Conversion to DataFrame**

The list of channel statistics has been converted into a DataFrame for easy manipulation and analysis. This DataFrame serves as a structured representation of the collected data.

**5. Visualization of Channel Statistics**
   
Visualizations have been created based on the channel statistics. Graphs representing the number of subscribers, total number of videos, and views have been generated to provide insights into the popularity and engagement of the YouTube channels.

**6. Video Details DataFrame**

Another DataFrame has been created by fetching detailed information about the videos of a particular YouTube channel. This includes data such as video titles, publication dates, and view counts.

**7. Visualizations for Video Analysis**

Top 10 Videos: A visualization showcasing the top 10 most-viewed videos of a specific channel.
Videos per Year: A graph depicting the number of videos posted per year for the year 2021.
Videos per Month in 2021: A graph illustrating the distribution of video uploads per month in the year 2021.

**Conclusion**

This YouTube Data Analysis project aims to provide valuable insights into the performance and trends of various YouTube channels and their videos. The combination of API usage, data manipulation, and visualization techniques enhances the understanding of YouTube content and audience engagement.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the YouTube channels and videos under analysis.
